# timedhash-token

timedhash-token is a proof of stake blockchain verification system for storing time-stamped hashes of data. 

The intent of this project is to remove centralized authorities from the file signing and time stamping process. Organizations like the [FreeTSA](https://freetsa.org) have come a long way in increasing the accessibility of time stamping, it is still an authority based system that requires an inherent trust in the service provider.

timedhash-token aims to remove authority requirements and hold it in the public trust using the inherent verfiability of a consensus-based blockchain.

Why is this in python? Who knows&#x203D;
